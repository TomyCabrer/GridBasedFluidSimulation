# Fluid Simulation in MATLAB

This project is a 2D fluid simulation that models incompressible flow around obstacles using MATLAB. The simulation is based on the Navier-Stokes equations and incorporates viscous effects, pressure fields, and boundary conditions. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interactively change parameters like grid size, obstacle size, angle of attack, and displacement.

## Features
- **User Interface (UI)**: Change simulation parameters like grid size, aspect ratio, obstacle size, and angle of attack (AoA).
- **2D Fluid Dynamics Simulation**: Implements a fluid simulation using pressure, velocity, and boundary condition modeling.
- **Airfoil Simulation**: Models airfoil interaction with fluid flow based on user-defined parameters.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can modify the grid size, obstacle position, and more.
- **Viscous Effects**: Adds viscosity to simulate realistic fluid behavior.
